<p>Some facts about stray cats and their impact on the environment and society 
  are listed here. Click any of the links below to read articles about the

issue from spreading further.</p>
<p>In Australia, the uncontrolled breeding of cats in the wild has caused a massive feral cat problem. They threaten native species and cause havoc in the balance of Australia's native ecosystems, forcing the govenrment to create a taskforce to combat the issue: <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/invasive-species/feral-animals-australia/feral-cats#:~:text=Feral%20cats%20threaten%20the%20survival,%2C%20bandicoot%2C%20bettong%20and%20numbat.">Australian Government Feral Cat Taskforce.</a> </p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.peta.org/issues/animal-companion-issues/overpopulation/feral-cats/">PETA</a>, around 60 to 100 million homeless cats live in the US. "Feral cats live short, hard lives on the streets. They never die of “old age.” Contagious diseases such as herpes viral conjunctivitis, feline AIDS, leukemia, and infectious peritonitis are common in cats left outdoors."</p>
<p> The Humane Society of the United States has great tips on what to do when finding a stray cat (or dog): <a href="https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/how-help-stray-pet#:~:text=If%20you%20are%20able%20to,a%20veterinary%20hospital%20for%20treatment.">Humane Society.</a></p>
