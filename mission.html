<p>Thank you for stopping by! This website is a college project for my Web 
Development class. I decided to put together something that would be fun but 
also serve a purpose. As someone who owns a rescue cat found alone in a 
parking lot in east Raleigh, I wanted to put my web development skills to work, so
I could help other animals in need. This website is completely nonprofit and my 
mission here is to help as many abandoned cats as I can.</p>
