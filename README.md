My Github account was created to publish my Web Development class final project on Github. 
The repository I created contains the source code for my Hope For Whiskers website and the images that go with it. 
I created a repository online on GitHub and using the desktop application I cloned it into my computer. Afterwards, I copied and pasted the contents of my website folder into the repository's folder, and published it to GitHub.
